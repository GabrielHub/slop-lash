# Prompt Design Guide

A reference for writing Quiplash-style prompts that consistently produce funny answers. Synthesized from Jackbox Games developer commentary, Cards Against Humanity design patterns, and analysis of what top comedians in 2025-2026 are riffing on.

## The Golden Rules

### 1. One Unexpected Specific Detail
The single most important rule. The sweet spot is between too vague and too specific.

| Quality | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Too vague | "A funny movie title" |
| Just right | "A funny movie title for a film about sentient furniture" |
| Too specific | "A funny 1940s noir movie title about sentient IKEA furniture in Cleveland" |

One qualifier reframes the prompt. More than one constrains it into a corner.

### 2. The 10-Answer Test
If you can't brainstorm 10+ possible funny answers in 5 seconds, the prompt is either too vague (infinite boring answers) or too specific (only one answer works). Both are bad.

### 3. Funny Words Do Half the Work
Certain words are inherently funny and prime the player for comedy: *boogeyman, grandma, clown, goblin, dumpster, Florida Man, pirate, wizard, raccoon, medieval, butt*. If your prompt feels flat, swap in a funnier noun.

### 4. Variety Over Volume
Don't write 50 prompts in the same format. Alternate between structures to keep the game feeling fresh. See the Structural Patterns section below.

### 5. Don't Overthink It
Simple prompts often outperform clever ones. "What's that smell?" is a legendary prompt and it's three words.

## Structural Patterns

These are the reusable templates that consistently produce laughs. Mix them freely.

### A. Worst/Best of (Superlative Frame)
The bread and butter. Set a scenario, ask for the worst/best/most version.

```
"The worst thing to [verb] [in/at/during context]"
"The best part about [bad situation]"
"The most [adjective] thing to [verb] [context]"
```

**Tip:** The more specific the context, the funnier. "The worst thing to say" < "The worst thing to say while being wheeled into surgery."

### B. Name/Create (Generative)
Consistently the highest-performing format in Quiplash. Players love naming things.

```
"Name a [product type] that [absurd qualifier]"
"Come up with a name for [absurd thing]"
"A rejected name for [known thing]"
"A terrible [brand/slogan/title] for a [noun]"
```

**Tip:** The qualifier should be unexpected but not random. "Name a candle scent for guys who peaked in high school" works because the target is specific and relatable.

### C. Fill-in-the-Blank (Mad Lib)
A familiar phrase or scenario with a blank. The structure guides the player toward comedy.

```
"I'm sorry officer, I had no idea it was illegal to ______"
"Instead of [normal thing], the world's worst [place] gives you ______"
"The real secret to [desirable outcome] is ______"
"Breaking news: Florida Man arrested for ______"
```

**Tip:** The best fill-in-the-blanks set up a specific voice or scenario. "I'm sorry officer" immediately puts the player in character.

### D. Authority/Formality Bomb
Set up a context of authority, formality, or gravitas — and the answer shatters it. From Cards Against Humanity, this is one of the most reliable comedy engines.

```
"The FDA just approved ______ as a food group"
"TSA now requires all passengers to ______"
"Breaking news: Scientists confirmed that ______ is sentient"
"NASA's next mission: send ______ to Mars"
"The newest Geneva Convention rule: ______ is now a war crime"
```

**Why it works:** The comedy comes from incongruity — the gap between the formal frame and the absurd answer. The more "serious" the authority, the funnier.

### E. Cultural Subversion
Take a well-known phrase, slogan, or cultural touchstone and subvert it with a blank.

```
"Maybe she's born with it. Maybe it's ______"
"Got ______?"
"[Brand] : We Have ______"
"Just Do It — specifically, ______"
```

**Why it works:** Everyone knows the original, so the subversion creates instant recognition + surprise. The audience does half the comedy work.

### F. Innocent Witness
A naive or innocent perspective encounters something terrible.

```
"A deleted scene from [children's movie]"
"A children's book titled ______"
"The most concerning line in a fairy tale: '______'"
"A terrible bedtime story for a five-year-old"
```

**Why it works:** Innocence + darkness = taboo-breaking tension that generates laughter.

### G. Hidden Truth / Secret Life
What X really thinks, does, or is hiding. Anthropomorphic humor and conspiracy-style absurdism.

```
"What [animal/object] is actually thinking"
"What [thing] would put on its Yelp review"
"The real reason [mundane thing] happens"
"What your [device/pet/thing] judges you for"
```

### H. Ironic Inversion
The best of the worst. Find the upside of something terrible.

```
"The best thing about [terrible situation]"
"A surprisingly good reason to [terrible thing]"
"The silver lining of [disaster]"
```

**Tip:** Works best when the bad thing is universally agreed to be bad. Prison, haunted houses, getting struck by lightning.

### I. Constraint Prompts
Limit the player's response to force creativity.

```
"Using only two words, [do something]"
"A four-word sentence that would [consequence]"
"In exactly three words, describe [thing]"
```

**Why it works:** Constraints breed creativity. Players can't rely on rambling — they have to find the perfect words.

### J. Confession / Self-Roast
First-person admissions. Players roleplay as their worst selves.

```
"I'm not proud of it, but I once ______"
"My search history proves that I'm ______"
"The hill I will absolutely die on: ______"
"My toxic trait is ______"
```

### K. Little-Known "Facts"
Pseudo-authoritative claims that players fill with absurdity.

```
"Little-known fact: ______ is technically illegal in 12 states"
"Scientists just confirmed: ______ is actually good for you"
"According to a recent study, 1 in 4 Americans secretly ______"
```

### L. Hypothetical / What-If
Speculative scenarios that open up creative space.

```
"If [animals/objects/etc.] could [human thing], the first thing they'd do is ______"
"If your last meal had to be from [place], you're ordering ______"
"What would happen if [absurd premise]"
```

### M. Juxtaposition (Dual Blank)
Two blanks that force unexpected pairings. The relationship between the two answers creates emergent humor.

```
"______ is the new ______"
"Step 1: ______. Step 2: ______. Step 3: Profit."
"Trade offer: I receive ______, you receive ______"
```

## Comedy Topics That Resonate (2025-2026)

These are the topics that top comedians and internet culture keep returning to. Prompts that reference these will feel current and relatable.

### Universal (Evergreen)
- **Domestic mundanity elevated** — pizza ordering drama, thermostat politics, IKEA trips, parking lot arguments
- **Pet culture** — emotional support animals, dogs sleeping in bed, "doodles are barely dogs"
- **Parenting nightmares** — kid art class disasters, school pickup hierarchies, birthday party chaos
- **Dating app culture** — swipe fatigue, profile cliches, ghosting etiquette, AI-written openers
- **Medical/health absurdity** — WebMD spirals, dentist dread, "is it serious?" anxiety

### Current (2025-2026 Specific)
- **Ozempic/GLP-1 culture** — Hollywood thinness, weight loss drug absurdity, shortage jokes
- **AI replacing human connection** — ChatGPT writing vows, AI dating messages, AI therapy, AI-generated comedy
- **Generational warfare** — Gen Z can't read cursive, Boomers can't use technology, Millennials are in therapy
- **Therapy-speak everywhere** — "boundaries," "toxic traits," "that's not a boundary, that's just rude"
- **Remote work permanence** — Zoom fatigue, working from bed, pants-optional lifestyle
- **Brain-rot humor** — unexplainable viral trends, brainrot characters, things that "go hard for no reason"
- **Celebrity scandal shorthand** — Diddy parties, hot criminals, leaked DMs
- **Crowd work comedy** — the "what do you do for a living?" as universal comedy opener
- **Climate/disaster anxiety** — played for dark humor, not despair

### Comedian Bit Inspiration
When stuck, think about what comedians are riffing on:
- **Nate Bargatze**: Clean observational — pizza ordering logistics, dog sleeping arrangements, his wife running everything
- **Nikki Glaser**: Award show roasts — Ozempic, Hollywood hypocrisy, hot criminals
- **Shane Gillis**: Sports roasts — nepotism, "he went 13-12 and almost won the Alamo Bowl"
- **Theo Von**: Absurd Southern metaphors — "adulthood is like eating soup with a fork"
- **Leanne Morgan**: Physical comedy stories — ski disasters, trying CBD for the first time
- **Taylor Tomlinson**: Religious deconstruction — faith trauma, confronting death
- **Matt Rife / Andrew Schulz**: Crowd work energy — rapid-fire improvisation, "what do you do?"

## Cards Against Humanity Lessons

CAH's design offers key insights for Quiplash-style prompts:

1. **The comedy is in the combination.** The best prompts are relatively neutral on their own but become explosive when paired with answers. Don't try to make the prompt itself the joke.

2. **Taboo topics need structure.** "During sex, I like to think about ______" works because the taboo frame provides distance — the player isn't confessing, they're playing a character.

3. **Formal setups amplify absurd answers.** Authority figures, official documents, news broadcasts — the more serious the context, the funnier the disruption.

4. **Cultural references create instant recognition.** Brand slogans, movie titles, famous quotes — everyone knows the original, so subversion gets a head start on funny.

5. **Dual blanks multiply possibilities.** Two variables create emergent humor from the relationship between answers. Use these sparingly for variety.

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

- **Too vague**: "Something funny" — infinite answers, none of them good
- **Too specific**: "A funny thing a one-armed clown would say to a nun at a rodeo in 1987" — only one answer works
- **Too restrictive**: Prompts requiring deep niche knowledge (obscure historical figures, technical jargon)
- **Restating the prompt**: "The worst joke" — the answer is just... a bad joke. No reframing.
- **Multiple qualifiers**: One unexpected detail is the sweet spot. Two is cluttered. Three is a maze.
- **Inside jokes**: Unless the audience is specifically your friend group, avoid references only 10% of players will get
- **Pure shock value**: Edgy is good; gratuitous is lazy. The best dark humor has structure and surprise.
- **Redundancy**: Check if a structurally similar prompt already exists before adding a new one

## Category Balance

A healthy prompt bank should roughly follow this distribution:

| Category | Target % | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Social Landmines | 15-20% | Worst thing to say/do in specific situations |
| Naming & Creating | 5-8% | Name a product, band, app, etc. |
| Hidden Truths | 5-8% | What X really thinks/does |
| Corporate & Modern Life | 8-10% | Workplace, tech, adulting |
| History & Pop Culture | 8-10% | Historical rewrites, celebrity absurdity |
| Kids, Animals & Food | 5-8% | Childhood, fairy tales, food crimes |
| Existential & Absurd | 5-8% | 3 AM thoughts, inversions, hypotheticals |
| Confessions | 3-5% | First-person admissions |
| Fill-in-the-Blank | 15-20% | Mad lib style completions |
| Memes & Internet | 8-10% | Meme formats, current references |
| Themed (NBA, etc.) | 5-10% | Audience-specific sections |
| Foreign Language | 3-5% | Multilingual Easter eggs |

## Process for Adding New Prompts

1. **Draft the prompt** using one of the structural patterns above
2. **Run the 10-answer test** — can you brainstorm 10+ funny answers in 5 seconds?
3. **Check for redundancy** — is there already a structurally similar prompt? (e.g., don't add a 5th "worst thing to say at a funeral")
4. **Check specificity** — does it have exactly one unexpected detail?
5. **Read it out loud** — does it sound natural when read to a group?
6. **Categorize it** — place it in the correct section of `src/lib/prompts.ts`
7. **Run `pnpm check`** — ensure no syntax/lint errors
